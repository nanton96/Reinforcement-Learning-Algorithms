# Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms

Implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms in the context of a course assignment.

Many of these algorithms require [HFO](https://github.com/LARG/HFO) to run.

The algorithms implemented are the following:
 
* Value iteration using bellman equations (dynamic programming)
* Monte Carlo
* SARSA
* Q-Learning
* Deep Reinforcement Learning
    * Asynchronous Q-learning using deep neural network function approximation [**Mnih et al., 2016**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf)

* Multi-Agent Learning
    * Independent Q-Learning
    * Joint Action Learning (table 4 in [**Bowling and Veloso, 2001**](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/02aij-mike.pdf))
    * Wolf PHC (can be found in [**Bowling and Veloso, 2001**](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/01ijcai-mike.pdf))
